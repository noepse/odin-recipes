        <h2>instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Arrange oven shelf to the middle of your oven. Preheat oven to broil/grill settings on medium heat.  </li>
            <li>Season salmon with salt, pepper and paprika. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the butter in a skillet or pan over medium-high heat until melted. Add the garlic and saut√© for about a minute, until fragrant. Pour in the honey, water and soy sauce; allow the flavours to heat through and combine. Add in the lemon juice; stir well to combine all of the flavours together.</li>
            <li>Press the tops of the cookies with the back of a fork (dipped in sugar) to make a crisscross design.</li>
            <li>Add the salmon steaks to the sauce in the pan; cook each fillet (skin-side down if there's any skin) for 3-4 minutes or until golden, while basting the tops with the pan juices. Season with salt and pepper, to taste (if desired).</li>
            <li>Baste salmon one more time then transfer the pan to your oven to broil / grill for a further 5-6 minutes, or until the tops of the salmon are nicely charred, and the salmon is cooked to your liking.</li>
            <li>To serve, drizzle with the sauce and a squeeze of lemon juice. Serve with steamed vegetables; over rice or with a salad.</li>
        </ol>
