        <h2>a simple 4 ingredient snack</h2>
        <p>These peanut butter cookies require only 4 ingredients which you likely already have at home!</p>
        <p>No flour, brown sugar or baking soda necessary - these cookies are simple, hearty and filling!</p>
        <h2>ingredients</h2>
            <li>1 cup peanut butter (regular or natural both work)</li>
            <li>1 egg (or one flax egg; see recipe note below)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup oats (old fashioned or quick)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
 
        <h2>instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. </li>
            <li>Mix all ingredients together in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Roll into 1-inch balls or drop by rounded teaspoons onto ungreased cookie sheet (I use a cookie scoop).</li>
            <li>Press the tops of the cookies with the back of a fork (dipped in sugar) to make a crisscross design.</li>
            <li>Bake about 10-12 minutes or just until the tops start to look dry.</li>
            <li>Cool 1-2 minutes, then remove from baking sheet and place on cooking rack.</li>
        </ol>
